# ng-signals-rx-app


## Overview
This is an Angular application that demonstrates the use of signals and reactive extensions (RxJS) for managing state and handling asynchronous operations. The project showcases best practices for building modern, reactive Angular applications. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.10.

## Features
- Reactive state management using signals
- Asynchronous data handling with RxJS
- Modular and scalable architecture
- Example components and services
